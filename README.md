# MUST.jl
Julia package for creating 3D stellar atmosphere models using the DISPATCH framework.
This package is capable of executing simulations via a SLURM distriubution system. It furthermore handles the reading, conversion and post-processing/visualisation of those simulations. It prepares the input for the Multi3D radiative transfer code. This package is complementary to the `TSO.jl` package, which is responsible for opacity realted questions.
